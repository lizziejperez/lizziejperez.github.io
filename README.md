# Portfolio Website

Live Site: [lizziejperez.github.io](https://lizziejperez.github.io)

This repository contains the source code for my professional portfolio website.
The site highlights selected software engineering and game development projects, along with detailed project documentation pages.

## Overview

This portfolio is built using:

- HTML5
- CSS3 (custom theme using CSS variables)
- GitHub Pages for deployment
- Feature branch workflow for redesigns and updates

The goal of this project is to maintain a clean, fast, and fully custom portfolio without relying on frameworks or site builders.

## Features

- Custom dark theme with accent-based color system
- Responsive layout
- Hero section with custom illustration
- Featured project cards
- Individual project documentation pages
- Organized folder structure
- GitHub Pages deployment

```

## Deployment

This site is deployed using GitHub Pages from the main branch.

Workflow:

1. Create feature branch (e.g. redesign-2026)
2. Implement changes
3. Push branch
4. Open Pull Request
5. Merge into main
6. GitHub Pages auto-deploys

## Design Philosophy

This portfolio is intentionally:

- Minimal but expressive
- Structured and readable
- Fully hand-coded
- Easy to expand

Each featured project has its own dedicated documentation page to present:

- Architecture
- Tech stack
- Implementation notes
- Future improvements
